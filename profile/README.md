## Hi there 👋
Welcome to TJ Physics Team! We give lectures about physics, solve
problems, and create fun problem sets - together!
We have a proud history of more members of the US Physics Team than
any other high school in the nation. Join us every Friday A and B Block during 8th period!

### The organization
This organization is for all code-related shenannigans related to Physics Team,
like for example [our website](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/physics/)!
